  "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.",
  "Whatever possession we gain by our sword cannot be sure or lasting, but the love gained by kindness and moderation is certain and durable.",
  "What we wish, we readily believe, and what we ourselves think, we imagine others think also."
